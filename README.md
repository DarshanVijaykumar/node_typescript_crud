Setup a simple backend api for storing a shopping list.
Few apis like:
Add an item to list
Get all items in the list
Delete an item from the list
If the user isn't authenticated, the api request should be rejected. Can be added later.
Store them in memory only for now instead of a database. Migrate it to use a database later.
